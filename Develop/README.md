# The Scheduler

## Description

The Scheduler is a mock up Schedule planner.
 - My motive for this project was to make a working Schedule planner that would allow me to plan my 9 to 5.
 - I built this project to learn more about Jquery, I couldn't play around with this as much as I did with JavaScript and got lost because I got used to JavaScript so it was harder for me to use Jquery.
 - This can be used to set a Schedule for a 9 to 5 daily basis.
 - I've learned that I don't know any Jquery and should keep playing with it.
 - I've also learned some Jquery, I'm still not the best and dislike it, but will do it if I have no choice.

## Usage

When the page is loaded up:
 - it has the correct date.
 - it has block with according time, text area, and save buttons.

 when I click the save button:
  - it is saved to localstorage and will stay there until I change it.

On this homework, I fell behind big time, for I didn't understand much of Jquery. Jason helped me picked up from what I knew and guided me to the finish line. We also worked with Joey, and when he was falling behind, it allowed us to look back at our codes to check for faulty code while helping him. When we got stuck on the save buttons, I asked Arthur for help and he managed to guide me to fixing it.
